All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning

Each component (Radar, PDF Generator, Deploy Tool, Web Frontend) maintains independent semantic versions:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (removed CLI flags, breaking API changes, incompatible migrations)
- **MINOR**: New features, backward-compatible (new flags, new endpoints, additive migrations)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward-compatible

**Version Locations:**

- Radar: `Makefile` → `VERSION := X.Y.Z` (injected via ldflags at build time)
- PDF Generator: `tools/pdf-generator/pyproject.toml` → `version = "X.Y.Z"`
- Deploy Tool: `cmd/deploy/main.go` → `const version = "X.Y.Z"`
- Web Frontend: `web/package.json` → `"version": "X.Y.Z"`

See [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) for detailed guidelines.
