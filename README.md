</div>

Street-level speed measurement for neighbourhood change-makers, researchers,
and anyone who needs evidence instead of guesswork about what traffic does.
Radar and LiDAR sensors measure speeds and movement: no cameras, no licence plates,
no individual is identified, tracked, or recorded. The data belongs to the community that collected it.

## Why velocity.report?

Communities trying to make their streets safer face a familiar problem:
everyone has an opinion about how fast cars go, but nobody has evidence.
Council meetings run on anecdote. Speed surveys cost thousands and arrive months late.
Meanwhile, someone's child is still crossing that road while motorists zip by.

velocity.report exists to close the gap between _feeling unsafe_ and _proving it_.

A radar measures vehicle speeds.
The logged data stays on a local device in someone's house.
The reports are professional enough for a planning committee.

Evidence over opinion. Privacy over convenience. Community ownership over cloud dependency.

## Who it's for

- **Neighbourhood groups** measuring speed on their street, with evidence instead of guesswork
- **Community advocates** building a case for traffic calming, with data strong enough for a formal submission
- **Transport agencies and government departments** running street speed surveys (whether for planning, compliance, or understanding what a road redesign actually did to driver behaviour) without the cost or lead time of traditional survey contractors
- **Academics and researchers** studying street-level vehicle behaviour with raw LiDAR point clouds, multi-object tracking, and replayable datasets
- **Perception and robotics engineers** exploring a transparent LiDAR pipeline: DBSCAN clustering, Kalman-filtered tracking, and rule-based classification; all tuneable and documented from raw UDP frames to classified tracks
- **Before-and-after studies** showing whether traffic calming interventions actually work

## Privacy

The system is built to measure traffic speed and protect vulnerable road users.
That defines what we log, what we store, and what we report.

The software does not collect, store, or expose anything that identifies an individual
or a specific vehicle. No licence plates. No faces. No make or model.
Object classification tracks road user types: pedestrian, cyclist, car, bus.
Not people. Not plates.

The data stays on a local device. Reports are generated locally.
If personal data reaches a log, a response body, or an export, that is a bug,
[please report it.](https://github.com/banshee-data/velocity.report/issues)

See [TENETS.md](TENETS.md) for the full set of non-negotiable principles.

### In practice: Clarendon avenue school zone

Clarendon Avenue runs past an elementary school in San Francisco,
designated a high injury road for years.
Parents worried about vehicle speeds and whether the city's planned repaving would actually help.

When the city announced a quick-build to repave Clarendon,
the Banshee team ran a baseline speed survey in June 2025 and sent the results to the city
engineering team ahead of their October planning meeting. The city repaved in December 2025.
A second survey in January 2026 showed what parents feared: speeds had climbed, not fallen.
The repaving, funded to improve safety, had made the school run more dangerous.

The team [presented the findings at a San Francisco City Hall street safety hearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTJOI5gYZM4) in January 2026.
The [full PDF is available at banshee-data.com](https://banshee-data.com/velocity.reports/2026-01-19_velocity.report_Clarendon-Avenue-San-Francisco.pdf).

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.25+, Node.js 18+, and pnpm.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full prerequisites.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:banshee-data/velocity.report.git
cd velocity.report
make build-web
make build-radar-local
```

The build produces `velocity-report-local`. Start it without a connected sensor:

```sh
./velocity-report-local --disable-radar --listen :8080
```

The server creates a new SQLite database if one does not exist.
Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the dashboard.
Use `--db-path` to point at an existing database elsewhere.

```

The web frontend and PDF pipeline connect over HTTP (:8080).
The macOS visualiser uses gRPC (:50051) for streaming point cloud data.
For the full architecture see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
Sensor fusion plans live in [VISION.md](docs/VISION.md).

## Development & contributing

Every contribution needs three commands:

```sh
make format    # auto-fix all formatting (Go, Python, Web)
make lint      # check formatting, code quality, and repo hygiene
make test      # run all test suites
```

These are the core quality checks for local development and CI,
but pull requests may also run additional repository or documentation checks.

Check out [docs/plans](docs/plans/) and [BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md) for any work that catches your eye.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for dev environment setup, coding standards,
and pull request workflow. All make targets are documented in [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md).

## Deployment

The Go server runs as a systemd service on Raspberry Pi.
See [public_html/src/guides/setup.md](public_html/src/guides/setup.md) for the complete setup guide.

## Vision: sensor fusion

The LiDAR pipeline already runs a full perception stack:
DBSCAN spatial clustering,
Kalman-filtered multi-object tracking with state and covariance estimation,
and rule-based classification across eight object types (car, truck, bus, pedestrian, cyclist,
motorcyclist, bird, and general dynamic). Radar provides independent Doppler-accurate speed.
Today, both run in parallel.

The next stage fuses them into a single scene model:
cross-sensor track handoff using Mahalanobis-distance gating,
Bayesian evidence accumulation for persistent geometry,
and canonical object refinement via streaming statistics.
A lorry clipping a corner at 35 mph tells a different story to a bicycle at the same speed;
radar captures the speed regardless, and fusion adds the geometry to tell the two apart.

The full plan is in [docs/plans/lidar-l7-scene-plan.md](docs/plans/lidar-l7-scene-plan.md) and
[VISION.md](docs/VISION.md).

### macOS LiDAR visualiser

Native Metal renderer for live and recorded LiDAR data,
with 96% bandwidth reduction through background caching and foreground-only streaming.
Requires macOS 14+ and Apple Silicon.

```sh
make dev-mac
```

Open the LiDAR Dashboard at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to replay captured point cloud
data (.pcap files).
See [tools/visualiser-macos/README.md](tools/visualiser-macos/README.md) for controls and camera
navigation.
