# Backend → Surface Publication Matrix

Mapping of all data structures computed on the Go backend to the surfaces
that consume them: **Web** (Svelte UI on `:8080`), **PDF** (Python LaTeX
generator), **macOS** (Metal visualiser via gRPC), and **SQLite** (database
persistence). Unpopulated or partially wired fields are flagged.

**Source:** Full-codebase audit (March 2026)
**Related:** [Remediation plan](../../docs/plans/unpopulated-data-structures-remediation-plan.md), [Clustering observability plan](../../docs/plans/lidar-clustering-observability-and-benchmark-plan.md)

## 1. Analysis Run Statistics

**Go source:** `internal/lidar/l6objects/quality.go` — `RunStatistics` struct (12 fields)
**Computation:** `ComputeRunStatistics(tracks)` — fully implemented, tested
**DB column:** `lidar_analysis_runs.statistics_json` — ✅ **now written** by `CompleteRun()`

| Field | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `avg_track_length_meters` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `median_track_length_meters` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_track_duration_secs` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_occlusion_count` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `class_counts` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `class_confidence_avg` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `unknown_ratio` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_noise_ratio` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_spatial_coverage` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `tentative_ratio` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `confirmed_ratio` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_observations_per_track` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Status (March 2026):** `AnalysisRunManager.CompleteRun()` now calls
`ComputeRunStatistics()` on collected tracks and serialises to
`statistics_json`. `GetRun()` and `ListRuns()` read it back into
`AnalysisRun.StatisticsJSON`. Web/PDF/macOS surface exposure is pending.

---

## 2. Track Quality Metrics (per-track)

**Go source:** `internal/lidar/l6objects/quality.go` — `TrackQualityMetrics` struct (8 fields)
**Computation:** `ComputeTrackQualityMetrics(track)` — fully implemented, tested

| Field | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| -------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `track_id` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `track_length_meters` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔶 |
| `track_duration_secs` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔶 |
| `occlusion_count` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔶 |
| `max_occlusion_frames` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `spatial_coverage` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `noise_point_ratio` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `quality_score` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Status (March 2026):** `InsertTrack()` and `UpdateTrack()` now write all 6
quality columns. The `TrackedObject` fields are populated by the L5 tracker
(`ComputeQualityMetrics()`). Web/PDF/macOS surface exposure is pending.
`quality_score` remains computed-only in `l6objects` with no DB column.

---

## 3. Cluster Quality Metrics

**Go source:** `internal/lidar/l4perception/types.go` — `WorldCluster` struct
**DB table:** `lidar_clusters`

| Field | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| -------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `centroid_x/y/z` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `bounding_box_*` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `points_count` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `height_p95` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `intensity_mean` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `noise_points_count` | 🗄️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `cluster_density` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `aspect_ratio` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Status (March 2026):** `InsertCluster()` now computes and writes
`cluster_density` (points/volume) and `aspect_ratio` (length/width).
`noise_points_count` remains unwritten — requires upstream noise-point
tracking in the L4 clustering pipeline (the `WorldCluster` struct does not
currently carry a noise count).

---

## 4. ML Feature Vectors

**Go source:** `internal/lidar/l6objects/features.go` — `TrackFeatures` struct (20 features)
**Computation:** `ExtractTrackFeatures(track)` — fully implemented, tested
**Export:** `ToVector()` produces a `[]float32` in canonical order; `SortedFeatureNames()` provides column headers

| Component | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| ---------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `ClusterFeatures` (10) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `TrackFeatures` (20) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `ToVector()` export | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `SortFeatureImportance` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Root cause:** Feature extraction is used in-memory by the classifier but
has no persistence layer, no API endpoint, and no export capability.
The pipeline exposes a `FeatureExportFunc` callback but no consumer is wired.

---

## 5. Noise Coverage Metrics

**Go source:** `internal/lidar/l6objects/quality.go` — `NoiseCoverageMetrics` struct (7 fields)
**Computation:** `ComputeNoiseCoverageMetrics(tracks)` — **partially implemented** (TODO at line 229)

| Field | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `total_tracks` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `tracks_with_high_noise` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `tracks_unknown_class` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `tracks_low_confidence` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `unknown_ratio_by_speed` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `unknown_ratio_by_size` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `noise_ratio_histogram_counts` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Root cause:** Entire struct is scaffolding for future coverage analysis.
The computation is a placeholder (counts only high-noise and unknown tracks;
speed/size breakdown is allocated but never filled).

---

## 6. Training Data Curation

**Go source:** `internal/lidar/l6objects/quality.go` — `TrainingDatasetSummary` struct (7 fields)
**Computation:** `SummarizeTrainingDataset(tracks)` — implemented (TODO: `TotalPoints` not populated)

| Field | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| --------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `total_tracks` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `total_frames` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `total_points` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `class_distribution` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_quality_score` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_duration_secs` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `avg_length_meters` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Root cause:** No API endpoint exists for training data export.
`TrackTrainingFilter` and `FilterTracksForTraining()` are implemented and
tested but never called from any handler. `TotalPoints` has a TODO: "Add
point count when point cloud storage is integrated."

---

## 7. Run Comparison / Split-Merge Analysis

**Go source:** `internal/lidar/storage/sqlite/analysis_run_compare.go` — comparison functions
**Computation:** `compareParams()`, `computeTemporalIoU()` — implemented

| Component | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| ---------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| Parameter diff | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Temporal IoU | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Track split detection | 🔶 | 🔶 | ❌ | ❌ |
| Track merge detection | 🔶 | 🔶 | ❌ | ❌ |

**Notes:** `is_split_candidate` and `is_merge_candidate` flags are stored in
`lidar_run_tracks` and exposed in the web UI's labelling view. However, the
comparison logic that _generates_ these flags (`compareParams`,
`computeTemporalIoU`) has no API endpoint — there is no way to trigger a
run-vs-run comparison from any surface.

---

## 8. Live Track Fields — Fully Wired (Reference)

These fields flow correctly from pipeline through all surfaces:

| Field | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| --------------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `track_id` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `sensor_id` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `track_state` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `position (x,y,z)` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `velocity (vx,vy)` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `speed_mps` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `heading_rad` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `observation_count` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `avg_speed_mps` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `peak_speed_mps` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `bounding_box_*` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `height_p95_max` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `intensity_mean_avg` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `object_class` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `object_confidence` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |
| `heading_source` | ❌ | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ |

**Note:** `heading_source` is published via gRPC and the live tracks API but
is not persisted to SQLite.

---

## 9. Radar Data → PDF Surface

The PDF generator consumes radar data only (not LiDAR). For completeness:

| API | Web | PDF | macOS |
| ------------------------------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `GET /api/radar_stats` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ |
| `GET /api/events` | ✅ | ❌ | ⬜ |
| `GET /api/sites` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ |
| `GET /api/site_config_periods` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ |
| `POST /api/generate_report` | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ |
| LiDAR analysis runs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| LiDAR tracks/observations | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| LiDAR sweeps/HINT | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

---

## 10. Speed Percentile Columns — Design Debt

**DB columns:** `lidar_tracks` and `lidar_run_tracks` both have
`p50_speed_mps`, `p85_speed_mps`, `p95_speed_mps`.

| Field | SQLite | Web | PDF | macOS |
| --------------- | ------ | --- | --- | ----- |
| `p50_speed_mps` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `p85_speed_mps` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `p95_speed_mps` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Status:** These are **design debt, not missing wiring**. Per the
[speed percentile alignment plan](../../docs/plans/speed-percentile-aggregation-alignment-plan.md)
(D-18), percentiles are reserved for grouped/report aggregates only.
Per-track percentile columns are the wrong abstraction and should be
**removed** via migration 000030, not surfaced to more UIs.

The `ComputeSpeedPercentiles()` function in
`l6objects/classification.go:514` is used internally by the classifier
feature extraction. It should remain internal and not be exposed as a
public per-track field.

## Summary: Unpopulated Structures by Severity

### 🔴 Schema columns exist but are never written (1 column remaining)

| Table | Columns |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lidar_clusters` | `noise_points_count` (1) — requires L4 pipeline change |

### 🟠 Persisted to SQLite but not surfaced to any UI (20 fields)

| Table | Columns |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lidar_analysis_runs` | `statistics_json` (12 fields within JSON) — needs API + web |
| `lidar_tracks` | `track_length_meters`, `track_duration_secs`, `occlusion_count`, `max_occlusion_frames`, `spatial_coverage`, `noise_point_ratio` (6) — needs API + web |
| `lidar_clusters` | `cluster_density`, `aspect_ratio` (2) — needs API + web |

### 🟡 Structs computed in Go but never persisted or exposed (4 structs)

| Struct | File | Fields |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| `RunStatistics` | `l6objects/quality.go` | 12 |
| `TrackQualityMetrics` | `l6objects/quality.go` | 8 |
| `NoiseCoverageMetrics` | `l6objects/quality.go` | 7 |
| `TrainingDatasetSummary` | `l6objects/quality.go` | 7 |

### 🟢 Feature vectors computed but no export path (2 structs)

| Struct | File | Fields |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| `ClusterFeatures` | `l6objects/features.go` | 10 |
| `TrackFeatures` | `l6objects/features.go` | 20 |

### ⚪ Comparison logic implemented but no triggering endpoint

| Function | File |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `compareParams()` | `sqlite/analysis_run_compare.go` |
| `computeTemporalIoU()` | `sqlite/analysis_run_compare.go` |

### 🔵 Per-track speed percentile columns — design debt (see §10)

Per the [speed percentile alignment plan](../../docs/plans/speed-percentile-aggregation-alignment-plan.md),
per-track percentile columns (`p50_speed_mps`, `p85_speed_mps`,
`p95_speed_mps` on `lidar_tracks` and `lidar_run_tracks`) are the **wrong
abstraction** and should be removed via migration 000030. See
[schema simplification plan](../../docs/plans/schema-simplification-migration-030-plan.md).
