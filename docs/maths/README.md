# LiDAR Maths

Status: Active

Mathematical assumptions and models used by the LiDAR pipeline.

## Scope

This folder covers estimation, filtering, gating, optimization, and confidence math that affects runtime behavior.

## Separation

- Implemented/runtime maths docs live directly in `docs/maths/`.
- Proposed or deferred maths models live in `docs/proposals/maths/`.

## Workstream Boundary

- Vector-grid foundations (current runtime path) are documented as implemented maths.
- Velocity-coherent extraction and other non-runtime models are documented as proposals.

Use directory listings for file-level navigation to avoid stale README indexes.
