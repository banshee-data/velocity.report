# LiDAR Development Log

## September 12, 2025 - Time-Based Frame Detection & Documentation

### Time-Based Frame Detection Implementation
- **Motor speed integration**: Real-time motor speed extraction from packet tail (bytes 8-9)
- **Frame timing adaptation**: Dynamic frame duration based on actual RPM (50ms at 1200 RPM, 100ms at 600 RPM)
- **Hybrid detection**: Combined time-based boundaries with azimuth validation for accuracy
- **Motor speed caching**: Parser stores last motor speed for frame builder integration
- **Testing validation**: Confirmed proper frame duration changes during RPM transitions (600→1200→600)

### Code Documentation Enhancement
- **Comment verbosity upgrade**: Comprehensive documentation updates in extract.go
- **Packet structure details**: Complete 22-byte tail parsing documentation with all fields
- **Timestamp mode documentation**: Added detailed explanations for all 5 supported modes
- **Calibration explanations**: Enhanced comments for coordinate transformations and corrections
- **Performance optimization notes**: Documented trigonometric optimizations and memory allocations

### Technical Improvements
- **CLI configurability**: Added --sensor-name flag for flexible deployment scenarios
- **Real-time adaptation**: Frame builder now responds immediately to motor speed changes
- **Accurate timing**: Eliminated hardcoded 600 RPM assumption, uses actual motor speed throughout
- **UDP sequence validation**: Confirmed proper handling of optional 4-byte UDP sequence suffix

## September 11, 2025 - Memory Optimization & Frame Rate Fixes

### Packet Structure Analysis
- **Wireshark investigation**: Analyzed Hesai Pandar40P UDP packet structure
- **Discovered Ethernet tail issue**: Extra 4 bytes appended to UDP packets
- **Tail composition**: 2-byte sequence + 2-byte unknown data (0x00 0x00)
- **Parser fix**: Updated tail offset from last 6 bytes to last 10 bytes
- **Validation**: Confirmed correct UDP sequence extraction and point parsing

### Performance Validation
- **Proper frame characteristics**: ~69,000 points per frame, ~100ms duration
- **Correct LiDAR operation**: Full 360° rotations with expected Hesai Pandar40P output
- **Debug logging**: Added temporary logging to diagnose, then removed for production

### Technical Discoveries
- **Ethernet vs UDP parsing**: Raw UDP data includes Ethernet layer artifacts
- **Tail offset critical**: Incorrect offset leads to malformed sequence numbers
- Frame builder processes points individually, not in packets
- Individual UDP packets contain only 2-3 points with small azimuth ranges
- Azimuth wrap detection must account for accumulated vs instantaneous coverage
- Point-level frame detection requires stricter criteria than packet-level detection
