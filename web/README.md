This is the velocity.report frontend web application, built with the following technologies:

- [svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

## Developing

We use pnpm for development, ([pnpm installation instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation)). Once you've cloned the repo and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` start a development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
